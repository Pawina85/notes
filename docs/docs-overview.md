## Markdown only

This page is a <code class="dog-inline-code">.md</code> file, not MDX

That means:

-No React components
-Just heading, lists, paragraphs, and links
-Styling is done via global CSS classes, like 
 <code class="dog-inline-code">dog-page</code> and
 <code class="dog-inline-code">dog-card</code>
