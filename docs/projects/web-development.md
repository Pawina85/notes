## Development Approach

### Architecture Philosophy
I believe in building scalable, maintainable applications using:

- **Component-driven development** for reusability
- **Clean code principles** for maintainability  
- **Test-driven development** for reliability
- **Performance-first mindset** for user experience

### Tools & Technologies
My preferred tech stack includes:

```javascript
// Frontend
const frontend = {
  frameworks: ['React', 'Next.js', 'Vue.js'],
  styling: ['Tailwind CSS', 'Styled Components', 'CSS Modules'],
  state: ['Redux Toolkit', 'Zustand', 'React Query'],
  testing: ['Jest', 'React Testing Library', 'Cypress']
};

// Backend
const backend = {
  runtime: ['Node.js', 'Python'],
  frameworks: ['Express.js', 'FastAPI', 'Nest.js'],
  databases: ['PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB', 'Redis'],
  tools: ['Docker', 'AWS', 'Vercel', 'Netlify']
