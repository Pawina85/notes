# My First MDX Document

This is an **MDX** file! It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## Regular Markdown Content

Everything you can do in Markdown, you can do here:

- ✅ Headers
- ✅ **Bold** and *italic* text
- ✅ Code blocks
- ✅ Lists
- ✅ Links and images

```javascript
// This is still a regular code block
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello from MDX!");
}
```

## Interactive Components

But here's where MDX shines! You can add interactive React components:

<InteractiveCounter />

You can also pass props to components:

<InteractiveCounter initialValue={10} />

## Mixing Content and Components

You can write regular markdown content between components:

This paragraph explains what the counter does. The counter above is a React component that maintains state and updates when you click the buttons.

:::tip MDX Power
The combination of Markdown's simplicity and React's interactivity makes MDX perfect for:
- Interactive tutorials
- Live code examples  
- Dynamic documentation
- Educational content
:::

## More Examples

<InteractiveCounter initialValue={100} />

As you can see, each counter maintains its own state independently!

## When to Use MD vs MDX

| Use Case | Markdown (MD) | MDX |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Simple documentation | ✅ Recommended | ⚠️ Overkill |
| Static content | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Unnecessary |
| Interactive examples | ❌ Can't do | ✅ Perfect |
| Live demos | ❌ Can't do | ✅ Excellent |
| Reusable components | ❌ Can't do | ✅ Great |

## Summary

- **Markdown (MD)**: Great for simple, static documentation
- **MDX**: Perfect when you need interactive elements or want to reuse components

Choose MD for most documentation, and MDX when you need something interactive!
